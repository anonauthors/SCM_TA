# SCM_TA: How to run the implemented code
The only thing you should follow to run the experiment mainly referred to in in-progress paper is to clone the repository into a machine with the following requirements:

The experiment is divided into several parts where each part is included in a different branch.
The only thing you are supposed to do is cloning the appropriate *branch* in a machine with following requirements provided: 

1. Provide a JVM through installing jre or jdk >= 1.8.0 on your underlying machine.
2. A minimum of 6 GB RAM and cpu > Corei5

In order to run the experiments, please go through following steps:
I. You could try to run the code from the terminal (CMD in windows) or using an IDE (we suggest eclipse in this regard). 
II. You just need to compile the provide code in src package and then run the Test1.class (in some other branches this is **Assignment** class) which contains the main method.
III. The results at the end will be located in the appropriate dirs.
